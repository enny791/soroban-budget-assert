# Tool Reference

## Macros: `budget_macros`

Both macros are attribute macros for test functions. They require a local variable named `env` (a `soroban_sdk::Env`) in the function body — the injected check reads `env.cost_estimate().budget()` after the original test statements run.

The check runs on every path that leaves the test, so all of these body shapes work:

```rust
#[test]
#[budget_cpu_lt(850000)]
fn unit_test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... the check runs after the last statement ...
}

#[test]
#[budget_cpu_lt(850000)]
fn result_test() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let env = Env::default();
    let wasm = std::fs::read("../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.wasm")?;
    // ... the check runs after `Ok(())` is evaluated, and it is still the test's value ...
    Ok(())
}

#[test]
#[budget_cpu_lt(850000)]
fn early_return_test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    if std::env::var("SKIP_SLOW_PATH").is_ok() {
        return; // the check runs here too
    }
    // ...
}
```

### `#[budget_cpu_lt(N)]`

Asserts that the CPU instruction cost measured by the test's `env` is strictly less than `N`.

- `N` is an integer literal (e.g., `850000`).
- On failure the test panics with:
  `CPU instruction cost {actual} exceeded limit {N} - local estimate, real network cost may differ significantly in either direction`

```rust
use budget_macros::budget_cpu_lt;
use soroban_sdk::Env;

#[test]
#[budget_cpu_lt(950000)] // local WASM ~901,816; testnet ~756,678
fn test_expensive_function() {
    let env = Env::default();

    let wasm = std::fs::read(
        "../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.wasm",
    ).expect("build the WASM first");
    let contract_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, wasm.as_slice());
    let client = MyContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
    client.do_expensive_work(&10_000);
}
```

**Dynamic limit** — read the limit from an environment variable at test time:

```rust
#[test]
#[budget_cpu_lt(env = "MY_CPU_LIMIT")]
fn test_with_env_limit() {
    std::env::set_var("MY_CPU_LIMIT", "850000");
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... test logic ...
}
```

If the environment variable is unset or not a valid `u64`, the limit defaults to `u64::MAX` (effectively disabling the assertion).

**Config-driven limit** — read the limit from a JSON configuration file at test time:

```rust
#[test]
#[budget_cpu_lt(config = "cpu_instructions")]
fn test_with_json_config() {
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... test logic ...
}
```

The macro reads `budget.json` from the current working directory and looks up the value for the given key. The expected file format is:

{% code title="budget.json" %}
```json
{
  "cpu_instructions": 2500000,
  "memory_bytes": 500000
}
```
{% endcode %}

If the file does not exist, the key is missing, or the value is not a valid `u64`, the macro prints a warning and falls back to `u64::MAX` (effectively disabling the assertion). This preserves backwards compatibility — existing tests without a `budget.json` file are unaffected.

On failure the test panics with:
```
CPU instruction cost {actual} exceeded limit {N} - local estimate, real network cost may differ significantly in either direction
```

### `#[budget_mem_lt(N)]`

Asserts that the memory bytes cost measured by the test's `env` is strictly less than `N`.

**Static limit:**

```rust
use budget_macros::budget_mem_lt;

#[test]
#[budget_mem_lt(500000)]
fn test_memory_budget() {
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... register contract as WASM, call client ...
}
```

**Dynamic limit:**

```rust
#[test]
#[budget_mem_lt(env = "MY_MEM_LIMIT")]
fn test_memory_with_env_limit() {
    std::env::set_var("MY_MEM_LIMIT", "500000");
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... register contract as WASM, call client ...
}
```

**Config-driven limit:**

```rust
#[test]
#[budget_mem_lt(config = "memory_bytes")]
fn test_memory_with_json_config() {
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... test logic ...
}
```

Failure message format:
```
Memory bytes cost {actual} exceeded limit {N} - local estimate, real network cost may differ significantly in either direction
```

```rust
use budget_macros::budget_mem_lt;
use soroban_sdk::Env;

#[test]
#[budget_mem_lt(500000)]
fn test_memory_budget() {
    let env = Env::default();

    let wasm = std::fs::read(
        "../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_contract.wasm",
    ).expect("build the WASM first");
    let contract_id = env.register_contract_wasm(None, wasm.as_slice());
    let client = MyContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
    client.do_expensive_work(&10_000);
}
```

### Requirements and caveats

{% hint style="warning" %}
- The variable must be named `env`. The macro resolves the identifier by name.
- A `?` that propagates an error leaves the test before the check runs. The test still fails on the returned error, so a regression cannot pass unnoticed — but the budget number is not measured on that path.
- A `return` that comes from *another* macro's expansion (e.g. an `ensure!`/`bail!`-style macro) is invisible to the rewrite and skips the check. A `return` written directly inside macro invocation tokens is rejected with a compile error instead of being skipped silently; move it out of the macro call. This applies to every budget macro.
- `return` inside a closure or `async` block in the test body is left alone — it exits that body, not the test.
- Run the contract as WASM (`env.register_contract_wasm`) inside the test, not as raw Rust — raw Rust estimates ran ~81% under real network cost in our measurements and make the assertion meaningless.
- Call `env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited()` before invoking the contract so measurement isn't cut short by the default test budget.
- The macro checks the *local* estimate, which can sit above or below the real network cost depending on the build profile. Set `N` a few percent above the measured local number to catch regressions, and use `cargo budget-report` for the network ground truth (see the End-User Guide).
{% endhint %}

## Soroban Budget API

The macros and manual tests interact with the Soroban budget API through `env.cost_estimate().budget()`. The key methods are:

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu_instruction_cost()` | `u64` | Total CPU instructions consumed since the last reset |
| `memory_bytes_cost()` | `u64` | Total memory bytes consumed since the last reset |
| `reset_unlimited()` | `()` | Resets all cost counters and removes the default test budget cap |

Example of manual inspection:

```rust
let budget = env.cost_estimate().budget();
budget.reset_unlimited();

// ... invoke contract ...

let cpu = budget.cpu_instruction_cost();
let mem = budget.memory_bytes_cost();
println!("CPU: {cpu}, Memory: {mem}");
```

{% hint style="info" %}
`reset_unlimited()` must be called *before* the contract invocation you want to measure. The default `Env` applies a low test budget that caps measurement if not removed.
{% endhint %}

## CLI: `cargo budget-report`

```
cargo budget-report [--network <network>] [--source <source>] [--json] [--check]
```

| Flag | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--network` | yes (flag or `budget.toml`) | Network to deploy and simulate against, e.g. `testnet` |
| `--source` | yes (flag or `budget.toml`) | Funded identity used for deploy fees and as the simulation source |
| `--json` | no | Emit the report as pretty-printed JSON instead of a table |
| `--check` | no | Compare measured metrics against `cpu_limit` / `read_limit` / `write_limit` declared per function in `budget.toml`; print a per-function+metric pass/fail line and exit non-zero on any breach or failed configured simulation |

Configuration precedence: a CLI flag overrides the `budget.toml` value. If neither provides `network`/`source`, the command exits with an error naming the missing field.

External requirements: the `stellar` CLI on `PATH`, a funded source identity on the target network, and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Rust target installed.

### `--check`: enforcing regression limits against network-verified costs

The `--check` flag turns the report into a CI gate. Behavior:

- Each measured metric is compared against its configured limit. A **missing** limit means that metric is **reported but not enforced**.
- A pass/fail line is printed per `function+metric` and a summary line counts how many checks passed and failed.
- `--check` exits with a non-zero status if **any** limit is breached, **or** if a function that has a `budget.toml` entry fails to simulate successfully — a broken simulation can otherwise look like a silent pass.
- Functions that are not declared in `budget.toml` are reported but never checked.
- `--check` composes with `--json`: every JSON entry for a configured function gains `limit` and `pass` fields. Entries with neither field stay byte-for-byte identical to the plain JSON output.

When `--check` is **not** passed, the plain text and JSON output of `cargo budget-report` is unchanged from earlier versions, so existing CI consumers do not need to be updated.

{% code title="budget.toml" %}
```toml
network = "testnet"
source = "alice"

[functions.do_expensive_work]
args = ["--n", "10000"]
cpu_limit = 5000000
read_limit = 5000
write_limit = 1000

# AMM pool functions are local-only; reporting is fine but they are not
# invoked via `cargo budget-report` end-to-end.
```
{% endcode %}

### Plain text output example (`--check`)

```text
=== WORKSPACE BUDGET REPORT ===
... existing per-metric table unchanged ...

Summary: ... unchanged lines ...

=== BUDGET CHECKS ===
amm-pool-contract::do_expensive_work [CPU Instructions] value=1,234,567 inst. limit=5,000,000 inst. PASS
amm-pool-contract::do_expensive_work [Read Bytes] value=2,048 B limit=5,000 B PASS
amm-pool-contract::do_expensive_work [Write Bytes] value=4,096 B limit=1,000 B FAIL
Summary: 2 check(s) passed, 1 failed
```

### JSON output example (`--check --json`)

```json
[
  {
    "package": "amm-pool-contract",
    "function": "do_expensive_work",
    "metric": "CPU Instructions",
    "value": 1234567,
    "limit": 5000000,
    "pass": true
  },
  {
    "package": "amm-pool-contract",
    "function": "do_expensive_work",
    "metric": "Read Bytes",
    "value": 2048,
    "limit": 5000,
    "pass": true
  },
  {
    "package": "amm-pool-contract",
    "function": "do_expensive_work",
    "metric": "Write Bytes",
    "value": 4096,
    "limit": 1000,
    "pass": false
  }
]
```

For a function declared in `budget.toml` whose simulation fails, an entry still appears with `value` omitted and `pass: false`:

```json
{
  "package": "amm-pool-contract",
  "function": "do_expensive_work",
  "metric": "CPU Instructions",
  "limit": 5000000,
  "pass": false
}
```

## Configuration: `budget.toml`

Read from the directory the command runs in (the workspace root):

{% code title="budget.toml" %}
```toml
network = "testnet"
source = "alice"

# Per-function invoke arguments, passed to `stellar contract invoke -- <fn> <args>`
[functions.do_expensive_work]
args = ["--n", "10000"]

# Optional enforcement limits consulted by `cargo budget-report --check`.
# Any field omitted means the metric is reported but not enforced.
cpu_limit = 5000000
read_limit = 5000
write_limit = 1000
```
{% endcode %}

- `network`, `source` — defaults for the corresponding CLI flags.
- `[functions.<name>].args` — arguments injected when simulating that exported function. Functions without an entry are simulated with no arguments; if a required argument is missing, the simulation fails with a warning and that function is skipped.
- `[functions.<name>].cpu_limit`, `.read_limit`, `.write_limit` — inclusive upper bounds for simulated CPU instructions, read bytes, and write bytes. Enforced only when `--check` is passed. A missing field means "not enforced" for that metric.

## Output

Each simulated function produces four rows (or four JSON objects) when its simulation succeeds: `CPU Instructions`, `Read Bytes`, `Write Bytes`, and `WASM Bytes`. For a mapping between these metric names, their XDR field names, and Stellar's own terminology, see the [Cost Terms Glossary](glossary.md).

Table output ends with a note that the values are simulated resource amounts rather than fees,
what is not measured, and that testnet simulations vary slightly with ledger state — see
[Measurement scope](#measurement-scope). JSON output (`--json`) is an array suited to CI:

```json
[
  {
    "package": "amm-pool-contract",
    "function": "do_expensive_work",
    "metric": "CPU Instructions",
    "value": 756678
  }
]
```

When `--check --json` is used, configured functions gain `limit` and `pass` (see [the `--check` section above](#check-enforcing-regression-limits-against-network-verified-costs)); the shape for unconfigured functions is unchanged.

## Measurement scope

`cargo budget-report` reports **resource amounts from a simulation, not fees**. It reads three
fields out of the `SorobanTransactionData` returned by `simulateTransaction` —
`resources.instructions`, `resources.disk_read_bytes`, and `resources.write_bytes` — plus the
compiled WASM binary size from the build step, and prints
them unchanged. Nothing in the output is denominated in stroops, and no figure it prints is a
total.

### In scope

| Reported | Stellar resource it corresponds to |
|---|---|
| `CPU Instructions` | `resources.instructions` — metered CPU instruction count |
| `Read Bytes` | `resources.disk_read_bytes` — bytes read from disk-backed ledger entries |
| `Write Bytes` | `resources.write_bytes` — bytes written to ledger entries |
| `WASM Bytes` | Compiled WASM binary size — the file size on disk after `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` |

These four quantities are *inputs* to the **non-refundable resource fee**. They are not the
whole of it.

### Not in scope

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not treat the reported numbers as what a transaction will cost. On Stellar, the total
transaction fee is `resource fee + inclusion fee`, and the resource fee is itself
`non-refundable + refundable`. This tool measures neither total, and does not convert what it
measures into a fee.
{% endhint %}

- **Rent** — the fee for creating ledger entries and extending their TTL. Rent is a *refundable*
  resource fee, charged up front and refunded against actual usage. It is frequently the largest
  single line item for a contract that writes persistent state, and it is entirely absent here.
  A simulation surfaces it in the `minResourceFee` and the returned `SorobanTransactionData`
  rent-change data; the [Fees, resource limits, and metering][fees] page explains how it is
  computed.
- **Other refundable fees** — the size of emitted events and of the return value are also
  charged as refundable resource fees. Not measured.
- **Transaction size (bandwidth)** — the serialized transaction and its signatures are charged
  as part of the *non-refundable* resource fee. So even within the non-refundable portion, the
  three reported figures are incomplete.
- **Ledger footprint** — the read-only and read-write entry *keys and counts* in the footprint
  are charged per entry, separately from the byte counts reported here. A function that touches
  many small entries can cost far more than its byte totals suggest. `stellar contract invoke
  --build-only` followed by `stellar xdr decode --type SorobanTransactionData` shows the full
  footprint for a transaction the tool has already built.
- **Total transaction fee** — requires the inclusion fee, which is a bid set by the submitter
  and not a property of the contract at all. The `minResourceFee` field of a
  `simulateTransaction` response is the closest single number to "what the resources cost";
  reach for that, not for this report, when you need a figure in stroops.
### What the report is good for

Comparing a function against itself over time. The three metrics are the ones that move when
contract logic changes, so they are the right signal for catching an execution-cost regression
— which is exactly what the Tier A macros pin into `cargo test`. They are the wrong signal for
answering "how much will my users pay".

## Failure behavior

- Build failure, deploy failure, or an unparsable RPC response aborts the run with a contextual error (via `anyhow`) — e.g., a deploy failure reports that the source account may be unfunded.
- A failed simulation of a single function prints a warning and skips it; the report still prints for the functions that succeeded.
- If nothing simulates successfully, the CLI prints `No successful simulations to report.` and exits 0.
- When `--check` is passed:
  - Any limit breach exits non-zero.
  - Any function declared in `budget.toml` whose simulation fails also exits non-zero (the warning is still printed), so a broken simulation cannot look like a silent pass.
